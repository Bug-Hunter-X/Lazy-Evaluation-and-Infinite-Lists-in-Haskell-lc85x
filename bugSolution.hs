The problem lies in the line `let anotherList = take 5 $ generateInfiniteList ++ [2]`.  Because Haskell is lazy, it doesn't evaluate `generateInfiniteList ++ [2]` until it needs to.  `sum` needs to access all elements of the list, and since `generateInfiniteList` is infinite, the calculation never finishes.

We can solve this by explicitly forcing evaluation of the `++` operation to a finite list before applying `take` and `sum`:

```haskell
generateInfiniteList :: [Integer]
generateInfiniteList = repeat 1

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let list = take 5 generateInfiniteList
  let sumOfList = sum list
  print sumOfList -- Prints 5

  let anotherList = take 5 $ (take 1000 generateInfiniteList) ++ [2] -- Force evaluation to a finite list
  let sumOfAnotherList = sum anotherList
  print sumOfAnotherList -- Prints 7
```

By taking a finite prefix (e.g., 1000 elements) of `generateInfiniteList` before appending `[2]`, we ensure that the resulting list is finite and can be safely summed.
